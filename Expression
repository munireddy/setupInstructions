Develop logic to return count of each word present in a file.

Sample Input file:
     If you have forgotten the password to your system’s root account, you don’t necessarily have to go back to square one and reinstall the whole operating system. 
     It’s possible to recover and reset the root password, even without the old password. In this guide, we’ll take you through the step by step instructions of 
     recovering a forgotten root password on Linux. 
     This will work regardless of the Linux distribution you’re running, as long as its using the GRUB bootloader. Other bootloaders will have similar instructions.

Sampel Output:
    a: 1
    as: 2
    if: 1
    step: 2
